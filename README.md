# Spam-Message-Detection

Spam detection means detecting spam messages or emails by understanding text content so that you can only receive notifications about messages or emails that
are very important to you. If spam messages are found, they are automatically transferred to a spam folder and you are never notified of such alerts. This helps
to improve the user experience, as many spam alerts can bother many users.
